# Simple Joker Poker hand check 
Defaut game has one player but more can be inserted by creating a new player.
On every run single 5 card poker hand is dealt to players and printed the poker hands.

jokerpoker_test_file has different poker hands used to test the code. 
Insert each hand to Deck class make_deck function under #Testipakka and comment out the creation of the whole deck.

This was my simple project to practicing python.
